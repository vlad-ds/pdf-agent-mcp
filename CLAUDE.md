## Feature Implementation Process
- Whenever we need to implement a new feature: read @plan.md, pick the next high level feature to implement, make a plan for implementing the feature, highlight questions and potential issues, and agree with me on the implementation.

## Project Reference
- Use the project at /Users/vladgheorghe/mcp/dna-analysis-mcp as reference for how to implement the MCP server (language, framework, project structure).
