  "description": "A Model Context Protocol server designed for agentic reading and selective PDF processing, enabling AI systems to efficiently navigate and extract content without context window limitations.",
  "long_description": "This extension enables AI agents like Claude to read and search PDFs intelligently, just like humans do. Instead of processing entire documents, this tool allows agents to extract specific sections, analyze table of contents for navigation, perform targeted text extraction, and process images with OCR only when needed. Perfect for research, document analysis, and searching through multiple large documents.",
